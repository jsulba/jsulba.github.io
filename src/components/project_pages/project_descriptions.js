    purpose: "Quantum Sim is a project I undertook with three other teammates at the 2019 McGill Physics Hackathon that involves quite literally a simulation for simple quantum computers. The goal of the project was to make the application of quantum mechanics in the field of computers easier to understand for anyone by providing a simple visual simulation tool. In other words, it lets anyone experiment with quantum logic circuits as they learn the theory on the side.",
    upt: "In terms of technology, we realized the project using Java, and JavaFX for the GUI. In order to stylize the interface, we also used CSS.\n The rest of the project consisted of translating the quantum mechanic theory into Java code. First, we had to implement qubits, which are essentially computer bits that have probabilistic states, rather than fixed binary states. Moreover, we had to implement state vectors to track the probabilistic system of all the qubits, which gets affected by the logic gates in the circuit. After implementing functions to handle those transformations (including superposition and entanglement), we implement a few algorithms, such as Deutsch's algorithm, to demonstrate the computational power of a small system of qubits. Here is an image of the interface.",
    challenges: "The main challenge I faced during this project was understanding the quantum mechanic concetps applied to computer science within the 24 hour time frame of the hackathon, to then create a whole interface to accomodate these concepts. I should also mention that I had to learn to implement certain functionalities that I had never learned before such as drag and drop in JavaFX. Lastly, in a broader scope, it was time consuming to find a limit on the number of qubits we could support in order to demonstrate our algorithms. For instance, with just 4 qubits, our Deutsch's algorithm would entirely consume the available RAM on the laptops we were using. In that sense, we were quite limited by our hardware resources, but we still managed to demonstrate the concept.",
    outcomes: "I learned A LOT during this hackathon. As I mentioned, I learned a few new tricks involving JavaFX, and I learned about an entirely new field of research in a few hours to then implement an application with that knowledge. Aside from those details, I also got a brief look into the kinds of problems that can be solved using quantum computing, which may prove to be useful as the technology becomes more accessible."
